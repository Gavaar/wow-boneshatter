# Boneshatter Calculator

I sell Boneshatter Helms (item) in World of Warcraft in a particular server. I have to update the sell value of Auction House components versus the sell value of Auction House Boneshatter Helm to calculate the profitability.

At first I did it manually, then, I created an excel sheet where I put the prices manually and it auto calculated profitability.

With this, I get the values from `theundermine` website to automatically calculate Boneshatter profitability.
